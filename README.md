## 1. Description

Given any mesh, we define a **grid** as any set of nodes that can be defined
over this given mesh. If the nodes are considered to define cells, each **cell**
with its own **cell center**, we then say the grid is a **staggered grid**.

These functions allow programmers to visualize a uniform staggered grids. They
can be used to research numerical methods for the solution of Partial
Differential Equations that act upon analog domains.

proposed template to document MATLAB files. I have used it here.
